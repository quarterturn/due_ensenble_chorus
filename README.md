# due_ensenble_chorus
a string-machine ensemble chorus emulation using an Arduino Due and PedalShield audio interface

Uses a pre-made wavetable which is read out to modulate the delay times and approximate the Roland RS-202 chorus effect.

Not really ready for prime-time yet. There's a periodic noise artifact I'm trying to find the source of. However, the overall effect is pretty dead-on.
