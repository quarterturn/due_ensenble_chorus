# due_ensenble_chorus
a string-machine ensemble chorus emulation using an Arduino Due and PedalShield audio interface

Uses a pre-made wavetable which is read out to modulate the delay times and approximate the Roland RS-202 chorus effect.

NOTE: it's working very poorly at the moment. You can hear the wavetable modulating the input, but there's a TON of noise.
